# About the Mississippi Coast Homeschool Concert Band

The **Mississippi Coast Homeschool Concert Band** exists to provide students across the Gulf Coast with the opportunity to learn, perform, and grow through instrumental music—regardless of prior experience.

We are a community-based ensemble designed for homeschool families who want a structured and uplifting musical environment without compromising flexibility.

## Our Mission

To enrich the lives of homeschool students through music education, performance, and collaboration—building discipline, confidence, and community through each rehearsal and concert.

## Who Can Join?

We welcome homeschool students ages **10–18**, from total beginners to experienced performers.

Students are placed in one of two ensembles based on skill level:

- **Beginning Band** – for new musicians
